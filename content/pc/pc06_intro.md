# PC 6

The Petite Classe is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the study of invariant manifolds, which we will conduct on toy examples to illustrate the notions seen in the course. The second part is devoted to a full study of the Brusselator system of equations, but from a different perspective compared to what we have done previously in terms of integrating the system in time. We will focus in this PC on the study of branches of equilibria. The third part of the PC is devoted to the introduction of the notion of numerical continuation of equilibria along branches parametrized by one of several parameters. Without resorting to a numerical integration in time, which can be time consuming and struggles to find unstable solutions, we want to follow branches of (possibly unstable) equilibria and detect bifurcations. We apply the simplest methods (natural continuation and pseudo-arclength continuation) to a series of systems we have already investigated and follow several branches of critical points.
