# Introduction to PC 1

In this Petite Class we discuss mathematical modeling of explosion phenomena.
When we study the evolution of the chemical composition and of the temperature of a tank filled with fluid energetic material, in order to know if there is a risk of thermal runaway and then of explosion, we can tackle the problem by studying the coupling of hydrodynamics and of the chemistry/thermic associated with the reactions which take place in the medium. However, before turning to a computer for numerical simulations, one has to choose within a hierarchy of simplified systems which takes into account various physical or chemical phenomena; this choice then implies a range of characteristic scales and one must in general have an idea about the mathematical structure of the system and
bring a precise understanding on the dynamics of the system and its qualitative behavior (one works in general in an incompressible limit or weakly thermally compressible written by the equations of Oberbeck-Boussinesq), before being able to simulate it. However, this understanding is based on two key ingredients:

1. knowing how to identify the right modeling hypotheses allowing to conduct a rapid and relevant analysis of qualitative behavior and therefore to work with the right level of modeling,
2. knowing the theory of dynamical systems in order to understand the possible behavior of the system under consideration.
