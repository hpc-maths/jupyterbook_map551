# PC 7

The Petite Classe is divided into three parts. The first one is devoted to the thermal explosion, within the framework of the Frank-Kamenetskii theory in one space dimension, as well as its link with what we have seen in previous PCs (PC1 and 6). The second part is devoted to flames, deflagrations, modeled through a traveling wave self-similar solution, which leads us to the resolution of an ODE on the full real line, and to a heteroclinic orbit joining two equilibrium points at infinity. Such a case has been encountered and presented in the course for the Nagumo equation, for which there is an analytic solution. Here we only prove the existence of a traveling wave, but its stability, as well as the numerical resolution in the phase space through shooting methods can be investigated. The last part is devoted to the simulation of a 1D Turing patterns, where the homogeneous steady state becomes unstable because of the diffusion and non homogeneous steady states appear.
