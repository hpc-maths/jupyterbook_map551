# PC 9

The Petite Classe is divided into several parts. In the first part, we warm up by studying the symplectic Euler schemes for a separable Hamiltonian. Then, we consider some generic one-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, consisting in a particle in a double well potential as well as the bead on a hoop, and study the behavior of several integration schemes. In particular, we highlight the differences between symplectic and non symplectic schemes for Hamiltonian systems. The final part is dedicated to celestial mechanics, which provide examples of higher-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. We study first the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system, and then come back to the Arenstorf orbit describing the motion of a satellite in the Earth-Moon system, which we had already encountered in the early parts of the course.
