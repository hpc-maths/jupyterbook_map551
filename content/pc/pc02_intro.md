# PC 2

This Petite Classe is divided into three parts. First we revisit, via basic  examples, some of the main notions presented during the lecture. Then we study classical mechanical systems, for which the friction-less pendulum is a simple but interesting example. Finally, we focus on population dynamics in order to tackle the question of the fundamental differences between conservative and dissipative systems, which can be found in the same modeling hierarchy of a given phenomenon.
